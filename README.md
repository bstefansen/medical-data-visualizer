## Why
I built this project to better understand Python's data science packages and utilize different modules like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Features
- Users can calculate data plots after running the program
- Users can predict correlations between conditions and patient data

## Installation
- Download Python
- Clone the repository into a local folder on your computer
- Open a Bash terminal inside your local folder
- Import the necessary packages by running these commands
  - `python`
  - `import pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn`
  - `exit()` 
- Start the main.py script by running this command
  - `python main.py`

## Development

For development, you can use `main.py` to test your functions. The calculations rest in `medical_data_visualizer.py`
